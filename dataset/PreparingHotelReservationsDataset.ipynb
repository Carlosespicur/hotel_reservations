A negative correlation rate means than when the value of an attribute gets high, the value of the other attribute decreases, and vice-versa. Positive correlation values suggest that both features increase or deacrease simultaneously. All attributes are fairly uncorrelated. It is noteworthy that the lead_time has the highest negative correlation (-0.43) with the booking status, the variable to predict. The number of adults and children are also quite high correlated with the average price per room, which seems reasonable.
